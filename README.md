# Getting Started with Create React App

I have created the project using create-react-app

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm install`

Run npm install to install the dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

##Eslint
I have used eslint for code consistancy and to avoid linting errors.

I have used Proptypes to declare the prop validations , eslint for formatting and to remove linting errors, material-ui for styling, react-autocomplete for autocompleting implementation , weather-icons-react for display of icons as third party libraries.

The application will auto suggest the city names once the user starts to type and on selection of the city the weather report will be displayed. The weather report includes temperature, day ,date, month with a weather icon and also a weather image.
The first component will display the current day current hour weather report. 
the second component will display present day's next 6 hours weather report.
the third component will display next 6 days weather report.


Since I have developed a one page weather application I have created the wireframe accordingly.
